# hub2bits

This is a more or less generic yet organically grown Hubâ†’JATS/BITS converter. 
It was commissioned by the Hogrefe group of publishers for their [HoBoTS](https://hobots.hogrefe.com/)
project. It relies heavily on infrastructure provided by other transpect projects, particularly
on the tanspect standard libraries [xslt-util](https://github.com/transpect/xslt-util) 
and [xproc-util](https://github.com/transpect/xslt-util). It is intended to be configured 
by a transpect [cascade](https://github.com/transpect/xslt-util), i.e., XProc and XSLT overrides 
for publishers, journals, or individual content items.
